However, he has not seen much financial success in the sport yet and does not have a bicycle brand as a sponsor. The sport of triathlon is extremely dependent on marginal gains in aerodynamics for competitive success. The fastest athletes in the world spend countless hours in the wind tunnel, testing various components and positions on the bicycle to become as slippery as possible.</p>

<p>Without access to resources like that, I have been using my knowledge of aerodynamics to design and print various components for Ari’s race bike in order to give him an opportunity to compete with the best in the world.</p>

<p>Being the logician that I am, I generally tend to fabricate conecpts for projects based on real problems that need solving. However, in this example, I fabricated a problem for myself, not because it needed solving, but because I was excited to solve it.</p>

<p>I have always had a love for classic cinema; at least ever since the age of 10 when my dad printed out the list of the 100 best movies of all time (<a href="https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-movies-10th-anniversary-edition/">according to the American Film Institute</a>) and stapled it to the TV cabinet in our house, insisting that I watch every film before the age of 18. A result of this “passion”, I of course now insist on educating all of my friends on all my favorie movies. This is the root cause of the problem I aimed to solve.</p>

<p>A few years back, while still living in Santa Cruz, CA, I had purchased a surround sound system, projector and 150in screen on Craigslist. This setup really did the trick, and completely satisfied my constant craving for visual media consumption. Unfortunately, it did not crave my irrepressible desire to educate everyone I know on classic cinema.</p>

<p>Luckily, when I moved to Seattle last January, I had an extra room in my house with plenty of room for my setup, and my mind began to churn on the idea of increasing the seating capcity in the theater.</p>

<p>It was on a chilly weekend in October that I insisted on borrowing my housemates truck to drive to Home Depot and pick up some lumber, carpet, and spray adhesive. If I could make some sort of raised platform in the theater, I could have two rows of seating!</p>
