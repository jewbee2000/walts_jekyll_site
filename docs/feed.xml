However, he has not seen much financial success in the sport yet and does not have a bicycle brand as a sponsor. The sport of triathlon is extremely dependent on marginal gains in aerodynamics for competitive success. The fastest athletes in the world spend countless hours in the wind tunnel, testing various components and positions on the bicycle to become as slippery as possible.</p>

<p>Without access to resources like that, I have been using my knowledge of aerodynamics to design and print various components for Ariâ€™s race bike in order to give him an opportunity to compete with the best in the world.</p>
