This summer I did a few weeks of volunteer research at UC Berkeley. I was asked to design a pruning attachment for the [FarmBot](https://farm.bot/?srsltid=AfmBOoqRhzMuiJLiP-o9ItITznpnXR070whCaood9Z0IdypC3U3dJaiO) that the AUTOLab had purchased in order to do a real-life demo of their polyculture optimization software.

When I showed up, the FarmBot had already planted a large gardenbox filled with various seeds acording to a deep-learning based maximization algoritm. The garden layout was simulated in a custom OpenAI gym reinforcement learning environment and compared to the physical testbed.

I decided to design a 3-axis servo arm and used a sharp pair of Japanese topiary shears as an end effector. I was able to have the new design working within two weeks! Here is the end result:

I also contributed several paragraphs to ["Automated Pruning and Irrigation of Polyculture Plants"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10506760) which was ultimately published in [IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8856) ( Volume: 21, [Issue: 3](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10631719&punumber=8856), July 2024)
